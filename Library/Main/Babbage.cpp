/* Custom C/C++ based library | Babbage
* Pass by reference for most part to improve performance and memory usage | Careful!
* Implement variable paramater amount for functions
* Find way to remove the need for '()' for certain functions. Low level C?
* Implement both vector and array versions of functions, with some exceptions
* Compile into a library file along with 'Babbage.h'
* Maybe incorporate some x86 Assembly into this for true overriding | MAJOR ADDITION
* Classes and structs can be implemented when necessary inside namespaces but for now change most to namespace
* Replace headers with C when necessary <vector>, <cmath> etc.
* Add unified error handling header/cpp
* Add proper byte compatability for different systems
