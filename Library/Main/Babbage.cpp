/* Custom C/C++ based library | Babbage
* Pass by reference for most part to improve performance and memory usage | Careful!
* Implement variable paramater amount for functions
* Find way to remove the need for '()' for certain functions. Low level C?
* Use the 'static' keyword for performance reasons (RESEARCH)
* Implement both vector and array versions of functions, with some exceptions
* Compile into a library file along with 'Babbage.h'
* Maybe incorporate some x86 Assembly into this for true overriding | MAJOR ADDITION
* Replace classes with namespaces, extremely important for the users sake and best practice for library construction | MAJOR ADDITION | MUST IMPLEMENT
* Classes and structs can be implemented when necessary inside namespaces but for now change most to namespace. Namespaces also allow for templates??
* Remove almost all headers and replace with custom C/C++ functionallity
* Replace all headers with C, <iostream>, <vector>, <cmath> etc. | There should be no headers. Babbage is the library which provides headers
