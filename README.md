Custom C/C++ general purpose library

To-Do-List:
  > Custom DSA implementation (WIP)
  > Graphics (Simple) | Console screen buffer based
  > External language intergration | Possible use with languages other than C/C++ (Language conversion libraries are in progress (Rust + Python))
  > Add custom datatype definitions (Might scrap)
